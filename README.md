This is a subproject of the *Kytos* project. This is the library component, in
charge of parsing OpenFlow messages to/from OpenFlow switches.

With `python-openflow` you can parse binary OpenFlow messages into python
objects, making easy to handle and understand theses messages. Also you can
instanciate objects and pack them into a binary OpenFlow message.

This library was developed to be used with *Kytos* controller, but feel free to
use this code in your projects/controller. Is a very simple and intuitive
library that also can be used to create your own controller.

## python-openflow structure

This project is packed as a python package (`python-openflow`), and contains the
following directory structure:

  - **python-openflow**: contains all the implemented versions of
    the OpenFlow Protocol Parser. Each version is under its own folder
    - Each version is inside its own directory
    - Each version is [incrementally build](#incremental-code) based
      on the previous version
    - Each version has its own unittest suit on the *tests* directory
  - **raw**: raw (binary) OpenFlow Messages, dumped with
    [tcpdump](http://www.tcpdump.org/tcpdump_man.html) used for Tests purposes

## Installing

You can install this package from sources or via pip. If you have cloned this
repository and wanna install via `setuptools`, please run:

  ```shell
  sudo python3 setup.py install
  ```

Or, if you wanna install via pip, please execute:

  ```shell
  sudo pip3 install python-openflow
  ```

## Using

_[todo]_

## Main Features

### Speed focused

We keep the word performance in mind since the beginning of the development.
Also, as computer scientists we will always try to get the best performance by
using the most suitable algorithm.

Some developers participated in several demonstrations involving tests with
high-speed networks (~ 1 terabit/s), some even involving data transfers from/to
CERN.

### Always updated

To avoid code repetition this project utilizes an incremental architecture.

This means that the first version (1.0.0 = v0x01) was fully coded from the
OpenFlow 1.0.0 Protocol. The 1.1 version (v0x02) imports the 1.0 version and
then do the necessary changes to make it compatible with the OpenFlow 1.1.0
Protocol, and the next version follows the same logic.

Using incremental code makes the implementation of new versions of OpenFlow
protocol faster. Yes, we are at initial stages of development, but our main goal
is always follow the specs.

### Easy to learn

We try to code in a "pythonic way" always. We also have a well documented API.
Learn to make your controller using this library is a trivial task.

### Born to be free

OpenFlow was born with a simple idea: make your network more vendor agnostic
and we like that!

We are advocates and supporters of free software and we believe that the more
eyes observe a certain code, a better code will be generated. This project can
receive support of many vendors, but never will follow a particular vendor
direction.

We always will keep this code open.
