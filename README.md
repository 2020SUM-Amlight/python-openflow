## Project structure
The **ofp** directory contains all the implemented versions of the OpenFlow
Protocol Parser. Each version is under its own folder.
Inside each version directory there is also the test directory.

There is also the raw directory, which holds some binary packets from OpenFlow
messages, and they are used to test the library.
